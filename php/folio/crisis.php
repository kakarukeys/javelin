<h2 class="content-heading">Crisis Monitoring Module</h2>
<h3 class="small-heading">The purpose</h3>
<p>Crisis Monitoring Module allows a client to be alerted of any unusual increase of chatter in the social media which often indicates a  crisis. This crisis may be a result of a major issue affecting the client's customers that is uncovered by the public or the media. Early alert allows the client to have more time to prepare for an immediate communication response.</p>

<p>Click the picture below to see how SMRT shareholders could have used the tool designed by me to uncover a PR crisis that happened on 17 August 2012 as a result of a power fault in North East Line even before the news broke out.</p>

<h3 class="small-heading">The algorithm</h3>
<p>The module uses a special machine learning algorithm developed by me, called <strong>anomaly detection in time-series data</strong> to keep track of the normal profile of the total mentions and calculate the threshold curve above which an anomaly is detected. Other features of the module include</p>

<ul>
    <li>The charting function and the user interface</li>
    <li>The text data analysis and summary function</li>
    <li>The monitoring and automatic email alert script</li>
</ul>
