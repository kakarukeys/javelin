<h2 class="content-heading">Medication Assistance Fund</h2>
<h3 class="small-heading">Background</h3>
<p>Medication Assistance Fund (MAF) was set up in 2010, to help needy Singaporean patients pay for expensive drugs used for specific medical conditions. The application assessment and evaluation process is handled by medical social workers (MSW) at all healthcare institutions. I was part of the team that built the IT system that implements the process. The project was constrained by various complex rulings in the healthcare sector:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Hospital billing is handled by different ERP systems depending on the settings: inpatient, outpatient, day surgery, etc. Each has its own unique data format and processing rules.</li>
    <li>The screening, assessment and evaluation process are dictated by Ministry of Health's (MOH) rulings, but they allow space for variation depending on the finance and corporate values of each hospital.</li>
    <li>MSWs have a workflow of their own.</li>
    <li>Patient identification and signature collection is handled by special hardware that operates on special drivers.</li>
    <li>Various changes by the stackholders need to be anticipated.</li>
    <li>Patient privacy rules dictate how the data is collected, stored, and shared among MOH and other healthcare institutions.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="small-heading">Completion</h3>
<p>Besides sharp programming skills and proper UI/UX design process, the project will need the programmers to use various soft skills: project management, customer management, agile practices, exploratory testing, etc. It was completed within schedule in 6 months satisfying all the above complex requirements.</p>

<p>The sytem went online in October 2011. It is now processing application forms from those who need assistance. This year (2012) MOH expanded MAF to cover more drugs and increase the subsidy rate. Many have benefited from the project.</p>
