    <p>After we receive the requirements of your project, we will perform a detailed breakdown and estimate the total effort needed. The hourly rate we quote depends on a number of factors.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The pace: how much effort you require in a weekly iteration.</li>
        <li>The manpower: number of developers to work on your project.</li>
        <li>The scope: total days contracted. We provide a discount if you contract more.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We practice evidence-based scheduling so that both you and we have full view and control over the running cost and the progress of the project.</p>
